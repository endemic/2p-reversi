[ ] Write some tests to for move validation code
[ ] Diagonal validation is broken - doesn't find the end piece correctly
[ ] Hints don't seem to work towards the end of a game
[ ] Change scene transition animation
[ ] Stagger the "flip" animation of captured pieces
[ ] Add a "countdown" type effect to the scoring numbers

Notes:
* The "game" scene is passed a "matchId" to indicate player is updating a Game Center game. That matchId property sticks with the scene, since the scene is never 
re-instantiated. So set matchId = null when transitioning out of the "game" scene.
* Change loadMatches to return a hash table instead of an array
